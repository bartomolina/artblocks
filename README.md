# About the project

When I fell into the rabbit hole of crypto, one of the things I found more fascinating was NFTs, and especially generative art. I believe that generative art has truly found its place in the blockchain and it’s an excellent use case for crypto. I find it remarkable how the space has survived the ups and downs of the markets and how it appears that the space is still as vibrant and moving forward.

Without doubt, [ArtBlocks](https://www.artblocks.io/) is the reference in the generative art space. They’ve done an amazing job promoting and curating artists. And without them, most probably it would’ve taken a few years more for the space to reach to the levels it is right now.

This project is a way to celebrate and appreciate the work that Art Blocks has done in the past years and the artists who published their work through them.

# Why CodArt.io

If you get interested in generative art (and more specifically Art Blocks) , there’s a few sites that will help you navigate the space:

- [Art Blocks](https://www.artblocks.io/):
- [Artacle](https://artacle.io/): If you’re interested in the trading side and information related to the secondary market.
- [Gallery](https://gallery.so/): A social network for NFT art that helps you discover net art and see what’s trending.
- [Tender](https://tender.art/): With some great articles and interviews about generative art and NFTs in general.

However, given my technical background, I was especially interested in knowing how Art Blocks works behind the scenes, how the Art Blocks contracts are structured, how to access the code behind the collections, and how’s the art is generated. CodArt allows you to explore the Art Blocks collections, and let you view and play with the code to see how the different outputs are generated.
